Node.js Roadmap for a 2-Year Developer
------------------------------------

1. Fundamentals of Node.js
- Event Loop & Async Programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- process.nextTick, setImmediate, setTimeout
- Core Modules (fs, http, path, events, os, crypto)
- NPM & Package.json (dependencies, scripts, semantic versioning)
- Streams & Buffers (read/write streams, piping large files)
- Error Handling (try/catch, async errors, custom errors)
Project: File server using Node.js streams

2. Web Frameworks
- Express.js (middleware, routing, error handling, static files)
- Alternative: Fastify
Project: REST API for Task Manager

3. Databases & ORM
- SQL: PostgreSQL/MySQL (Joins, Indexes, Transactions, pooling)
- NoSQL: MongoDB (Collections, Indexes, Aggregations)
- ORM/ODM: Sequelize/Prisma/TypeORM (SQL), Mongoose (MongoDB)
Project: Extend Task Manager with DB

4. Authentication & Security
- JWT, Refresh tokens, OAuth2, Passport.js
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Security: Helmet.js, Rate limiting, bcrypt/argon2
Project: Add auth system to Task Manager

5. Advanced Backend Features
- File Uploads (Multer, Busboy)
- Sending Emails (Nodemailer)
- Background Jobs (Bull + Redis)
- API Pagination & Filtering
- Centralized Logging (Winston/Pino)
Project: E-commerce API

6. Testing & Quality
- Jest / Mocha for Unit tests
- Supertest for Integration tests
- ESLint, Prettier
- TDD basics
Project: Tests for E-commerce API

7. Deployment & DevOps
- PM2 process manager
- dotenv for environment variables
- Dockerize Node.js apps
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Render, Railway, Vercel)
Project: Deploy E-commerce API with Docker + CI/CD

8. Scaling & Performance
- Caching with Redis
- Load balancing (NGINX, PM2 cluster mode)
- Worker Threads & Clustering
- Rate limiting & Throttling
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog)
Project: Add Redis caching & rate limiting

9. Microservices & Advanced Architecture
- Monolith vs Microservices
- gRPC vs REST
- Message Brokers (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Pub/Sub)
- API Gateway basics
- Service discovery
Project: Split E-commerce API into Microservices

10. TypeScript with Node.js
- TypeScript basics
- Typings for Express, Mongoose, etc.
- DTOs & Interfaces
- Dependency Injection
Project: Rewrite Task Manager in TypeScript

Final Checklist
- Strong in JS & Async programming
- Built REST APIs with Express/Fastify
- Worked with SQL & NoSQL DBs
- Implemented Auth & Security
- Used ORM/ODM (Mongoose, Prisma, Sequelize)
- Familiar with Testing (Jest, Supertest)
- Deployed apps with Docker + PM2
- Basic knowledge of Scaling, Caching, Microservices
- Comfortable with TypeScript in Node.js
